##Installing

**Bower**
```sh
bower install --save /* whatever name we decide on */
```
This should download angular as well, which is required.


**NPM**
```sh
npm install --save /* whatever name we decide on */
```
You will need angular as well. will look into doing this with npm for browserify
or use with [cherrio][1].

##Contributing

Obviously we would love you to contribute your ideas as well as code!

We only ask that you write tests for code you contribute (if applicable) and
adhere to the coding style that is already in the files.

###Getting Started

Fork the project. Even maintainers will be using forks.

We will be using gulp and bower for this project. Thus, you will need to run `npm install`
and `bower install`.

After that, you should be good to go. Happy hunting!

##Release History

Coming soon...
